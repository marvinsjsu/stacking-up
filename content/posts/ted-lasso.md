I confess, the only reason I gave Ted Lasso a watch was because I was stuck at home in isolation, not really able to walk much
cuz my knee ballooned to what looked like half a baseball (psoriatic arthritis, not that I knew that was the reason then),
and I had a free 3-month trial for Apple TV.  It was the first Apple TV show I felt curious about - why is Jason Sudeikis
wearing that stache?  

They say you can’t judge a book by its cover, but in the case of Ted Lasso, it's pretty easy to assume this goofy-looking
coach of a British football team would dish out more slapstick than soul-searching. Yet, I've never been so happy to be SO 
wrong!  Ted and his crew of flawed misfits remind us what it means to be human - during a time that I think
many of us really needed to feel and remember our humanity.

In the very first episode, one of the first things Ted does is post a "Believe" sign high on a wall in his new team's
locker room.  Believe in what? We eventually learn that this means believing in each other, believing on what we can
do together, believing in ourselves, and believing in people overcoming the many challenges and obstacles life
throws at us.

Belief, at its core, is an act of empathy. To believe in someone is to understand them and their struggles, their dreams,
their potential, and to let them know you’re in their corner. Ted Lasso doesn’t just tell his team to believe; he shows
them what belief looks like. It’s in the way he listens, the way he supports, and the way he cares. Empathy is what
transforms belief from a feel-good slogan into a transformative force. When we believe in others, we’re not just
giving them permission to succeed; we’re giving them the courage to try.

It's the quiet superpower we never knew we needed in life ... and, it's quite important in being a good software engineer
and leader!  See, even if we are individual contributors and don't have the title of a lead or manager, each of us, as
a software engineer is a leader in so many ways.  We lead in our thoughts, ideas, and how we treat and interact with
others.

This is where the power of belief, care, and kindness comes into play. Let’s face it: being a software engineer can sometimes feel like you’re stuck in an endless penalty shootout against bugs, deadlines, and documentation. It's easy to be so mechanical and operate with blinders on. "I just gotta get this ish done!", I've told this myself and the keyboard many times.  It can sometimes be easy to lose sight of the people we work with.  Empathy works so well when it moves across all directions: left/right, from top-down, and bottom-up.

Empathy in software engineering is understanding that the bug someone shipped isn’t a reflection of their competence but perhaps a result of the four hours of sleep they got while juggling a sick kid at home. It’s about realizing that the terse Slack message from your colleague isn’t rudeness but stress manifesting in the only way it knows how. It’s pausing long enough to see the human behind the GitHub avatar.  It's offering to pair on a ticket without putting on a show.  It's reviewing a PR and mindfully offering alternative approaches and explanations with some gentleness - "I think we might be able to ... ", and "I feel like we can ... ".  

Empathy is allowing our team to explore solutions, discuss these openly, provide the time for feedback, and delay any judgment.  It is about fully being present for one-on-ones - focused on the person on the other end of the table or Zoom call. It is to be genuinely curious of our team members mental and emotional state, and to be sincere with our guidance.  It can be just to listen, acknowledge, and say, "I have to think a bit more about this, mind if we circle back?" It can sometimes mean setting aside our ego - that we know more, that we are right, that we are better.   It's about allowing someone to take on more and supporting them if they falter.  It is about giving those nudges, sharing some words of encouragement - bringing that biscuit or two 🍪.

Empathy is respecting our manager's time, understanding that there may be constraints that we aren't privy to, that transparency and being clear with our intentions and our situations gives them the clarity to help and guide towards an outcome of shared expectations.  Being on time for calls and coming prepared with ideas and questions. It is about giving trust, sometimes blind, that they have our best interests.  

Ted Lasso doesn’t just preach empathy; he lives it. He’s not the best at tactics - he doesn't even know the rules. But he knows people. He sees their fears, their dreams, their insecurities, and, more importantly, he cares. And that’s the essence of his catchphrase: "Believe". It’s not just about believing in the impossible; it’s about believing in each other. When software engineers adopt that mindset, magic happens. Suddenly, code reviews aren’t just about nitpicking variable names; they’re about mentoring a junior dev who’s terrified of being seen as incompetent. Team meetings stop being rituals of passive-aggressive "discussions" or insincere guidance, and start becoming spaces where people feel safe to ask for help, share ideas, or admit they’re stuck.

Here’s the kicker ⚽️: empathy isn’t easy. It’s messy. It requires vulnerability, patience, and in the case of Ted Lasso, an almost reckless amount of optimism. There’s a scene in the show where Ted says, “Be curious, not judgmental.” That’s the kind of mantra every engineer and leader should tattoo on their brain. Be curious about why your teammate approached the problem differently. Be curious about what’s causing the friction in your team dynamics. And for sure, be curious about why Jenkins is always breaking at 3 a.m. 😅

In the end, to me, Ted Lasso isn’t about the most beautiful game, just like software engineering isn’t only about writing code. It’s about people. It’s about connections. It’s about showing up—for your team, for yourself, and sometimes, for the person who didn’t know they needed you to. So go ahead, channel your inner Ted. Believe in your team. Approach your work with a dash of humor, a huge dollop of kindness, and a bus full of biscuits. Who knows? You might just find that, in the process, you’ve built more than just software. You’ve built trust, camaraderie, and a team that’s not just functional but extraordinary.

I confess, the only reason I gave Ted Lasso a watch was because I was stuck at home in isolation, not really able to walk much cuz my right knee ballooned to what looked like half a baseball (psoriatic arthritis, not that I knew that was the reason then), and I had a free 3-month trial for Apple TV.  It was the first Apple TV show I felt curious about - why is Jason Sudeikis

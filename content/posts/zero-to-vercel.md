### From Zero To Vercel: My Freelance Leap with Ctrlyr

#### Introduction: React's Fullstack Framework

I confess, the only reason I gave *Ted Lasso* a watch was because I was stuck at home in isolation, unable to walk because my right knee had ballooned to what looked like half a baseball (psoriatic arthritis, though I didn’t know it at the time). With a free three-month Apple TV trial and curious about Jason Sudeikis’ stache, I hit play.

What I didn’t expect was how much this show would resonate. Ted Lasso’s seemingly goofy character disguises a profound exploration of what it means to lead with belief, empathy, and kindness — qualities that aren’t just for sports coaches but for all of us, especially as software engineers and leaders.
